## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `new World({ gravity })`, with `world.gravity`, `world.bodyCount`, `world.step(dt)` and
  `world.destroy()`. A step is exactly `dt` seconds of semi-implicit Euler: gravity for dynamic
  bodies, velocity for dynamic and kinematic ones.
- Bodies: `world.addBody`, `world.setBody`, `world.bodyOf`, `world.remove` and `world.body(id)`.
  Box, sphere and capsule shapes, with mass from the shape's volume and a density (water's by
  default) unless a mass is given. Dynamic, static and kinematic types.
- `Body` handles: `id`, `slot`, `world`, `alive`, `mass`, read-only copies of `position`,
  `rotation`, `velocity` and `angularVelocity`, and the chaining setters `setPosition`,
  `setRotation`, `setAxisAngle`, `setEuler`, `setVelocity` and `setAngularVelocity`.
- `world.transforms` and `world.previous`: every body's position and rotation as one
  `Float32Array`, now and before the last step, for any renderer to copy and interpolate.
- Ids that can never reach the wrong body: a 24-bit slot and a 29-bit generation in one exact
  number. Storage that grows as bodies are added and shrinks as they go.
- Bit-identical results on every machine: nothing in Bearing calls an implementation-approximated
  function, and rotations from angles use Bearing's own sine and cosine.
- Every error names its call, its option, what it must be and what it got, and an unknown option
  suggests the nearest real one.
